# Overview
This is a ROS 2 package for Boston Dynamics' Spot, aka. Conq. The package contains all necessary topics, services and actions to teleoperate or navigate Spot. This package currently corresponds to version 4.0.2 of the [spot-sdk](https://github.com/boston-dynamics/spot-sdk/releases/tag/v4.0.2).

## Prerequisites
This package is tested for Ubuntu 22.04.4, Python 3.12.4, conda 24.5.0, and ROS2 Humble, which can be installed following [this guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html). 

## Installation
In your ROS 2 workspace `src` directory, clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:UM-ARM-Lab/conq_ros.git
```
or 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/UM-ARM-ALB/conq_ros.git
```

and initialize and install the submodules:
```bash
cd conq_ros
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Then run the install script to install the necessary Boston Dynamics and ROS dependencies. The install script takes the optional argument ```--arm64```; it otherwise defaults to an AMD64 install. Run the correct command based on your system:
```bash
cd <path to conq_ros>
./install_conq_ros.sh
or
./install_conq_ros.sh --arm64
```
From here, build and source the ROS 2 workspace:
```
cd <ros2 ws>
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
colcon build --symlink-install --packages-ignore proto2ros_tests
source install/local_setup.bash
```

We suggest ignoring the `proto2ros_tests` package in the build as it is not necessary for running the driver. If you choose to build it, you will see a number of error messages from testing the failure paths. 

# Spot ROS 2 Driver 

### FIXME: Some parameters not working as expected 

The Spot driver contains all of the necessary topics, services, and actions for controlling Spot over ROS 2. To launch the driver, run:
```
ros2 launch spot_driver spot_driver.launch.py [config_file:=<path/to/config.yaml>] [spot_name:=Conq] [publish_point_clouds:=<True|False>] [launch_rviz:=<True|False>] [uncompress_images:=<True|False>] [publish_compressed_images:=<True|False>]
```

## Configuration

The Spot login data hostname, username and password can be specified either as ROS parameters or as environment variables.  If using ROS parameters, see [`spot_driver/config/spot_ros_example.yaml`](spot_driver/config/spot_ros_example.yaml) for an example of what your file could look like.  If using environment variables, define `BOSDYN_CLIENT_USERNAME`, `BOSDYN_CLIENT_PASSWORD`, and `SPOT_IP`.

## Simple Robot Commands
Many simple robot commands can be called as services from the command line once the driver is running. For example:

* `ros2 service call /Conq/sit std_srvs/srv/Trigger`
* `ros2 service call /Conq/stand std_srvs/srv/Trigger`
* `ros2 service call /Conq/undock std_srvs/srv/Trigger`
* `ros2 service call /Conq/power_off std_srvs/srv/Trigger`

If your Spot has an arm, some additional helpful services are exposed:
* `ros2 service call /Conq/arm_stow std_srvs/srv/Trigger`
* `ros2 service call /Conq/arm_unstow std_srvs/srv/Trigger`
* `ros2 service call /Conq/arm_carry std_srvs/srv/Trigger`
* `ros2 service call /Conq/open_gripper std_srvs/srv/Trigger`
* `ros2 service call /Conq/close_gripper std_srvs/srv/Trigger`

The full list of interfaces provided by the driver can be explored via `ros2 topic list`, `ros2 service list`, and `ros2 action list`. For more information about the custom message types used in this package, run `ros2 interface show <interface_type>`.

## Examples
See [`spot_examples`](spot_examples/) for some more complex examples of using the ROS 2 driver to control Conq, which typically use the action servers provided by the driver. 

## Images
Perception data from Spot is handled through the `spot_image_publishers.launch.py` launchfile, which is launched by default from the driver. If you want to only view images from Spot, without bringing up any of the nodes to control the robot, you can also choose to run this launchfile independently.

By default, the driver will publish RGB images as well as depth maps from the `frontleft`, `frontright`, `left`, `right`, and `back` cameras on Spot (plus `hand` if your Spot has an arm). You can customize the cameras that are streamed from by adding the `cameras_used` parameter to your config yaml. (For example, to stream from only the front left and front right cameras, you can add `cameras_used: ["frontleft", "frontright"]`). Additionally, if your Spot has greyscale cameras, you will need to set `rgb_cameras: False` in your configuration YAML file, or you will not receive any image data.

By default, the driver does not publish point clouds. To enable this, launch the driver with `publish_point_clouds:=True`.

The driver can publish both compressed images (under `/Conq/camera/<camera location>/compressed`) and uncompressed images (under `/Conq/camera/<camera location>/image`). By default, it will only publish the uncompressed images. You can turn (un)compressed images on/off by launching the driver with the flags `uncompress_images:=<True|False>` and `publish_compressed_images:=<True|False>`.

The driver also has the option to publish a stitched image created from Conq's front left and front right cameras (similar to what is seen on the tablet). If you wish to enable this, launch the driver with `stitch_front_images:=True`, and the image will be published under `/Conq/camera/frontmiddle_virtual/image`. In order to receive meaningful stitched images, you will have to specify the parameters `virtual_camera_intrinsics`, `virtual_camera_projection_plane`, `virtual_camera_plane_distance`, and `stitched_image_row_padding` (see [`spot_driver/config/spot_ros_example.yaml`](spot_driver/config/spot_ros_example.yaml) for some default values). 

> **_NOTE:_**  
If your image publishing rate is very slow, you can try 
> - connecting to your robot via ethernet cable 
> - exporting a custom DDS profile we have provided by running the following in the same terminal your driver will run in, or adding to your `.bashrc`:
> ```
> export=FASTRTPS_DEFAULT_PROFILES_FILE=<path_to_file>/custom_dds_profile.xml
> ```

## Spot CAM
Due to known issues with the Spot CAM, it is disabled by default. To enable publishing and usage over the driver, add the following command in your configuration YAML file:
    `initialize_spot_cam: True`

The Spot CAM payload has known issues with the SSL certification process in https. If you get the following errors:

```
non-existing PPS 0 referenced
decode_slice_header error
no frame!
```

Then you want to log into the Spot CAM over the browser. In your browser, type in:

    https://<ip_address_of_spot>:<sdp_port>/h264.sdp.html

The default port for SDP is 31102 for the Spot CAM. Once inside, you will be prompted to log in using your username and password. Do so and the WebRTC frames should begin to properly stream.


# Advanced Install

## Install spot_msgs as a deb package
`spot_msgs` are normally compiled as part of this repository.  If you would prefer to install them as a debian package, follow the steps below:
```bash
wget -q -O /tmp/ros-humble-spot-msgs_0.0.0-0jammy_amd64.deb https://github.com/bdaiinstitute/spot_ros2/releases/download/spot_msgs-v0.0-0/ros-humble-spot-msgs_0.0.0-0jammy_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i /tmp/ros-humble-spot-msgs_0.0.0-0jammy_amd64.deb
rm /tmp/ros-humble-spot-msgs_0.0.0-0jammy_amd64.deb
```

## Install bosdyn_msgs from source
The `bosdyn_msgs` package is installed as a debian package as part of the `install_spot_ros2` script because it's very large.  It can be checked out from source [here](https://github.com/bdaiinstitute/bosdyn_msgs) and then built as a normal ROS 2 package if that is preferred (compilation takes about 15 minutes).


## Verify Package Versions
If you encounter `ModuleNotFoundErrors` with `bosdyn` packages upon running the driver, it is likely that the necessary Boston Dynamics API packages did not get installed with `install_spot_ros2.sh`. To check this, you can run the following command. Note that all versions should be `4.0.2`. 
```bash
$ pip list | grep bosdyn
bosdyn-api                               4.0.2
bosdyn-api-msgs                          4.0.2
bosdyn-auto-return-api-msgs              4.0.2
bosdyn-autowalk-api-msgs                 4.0.2
bosdyn-choreography-client               4.0.2
bosdyn-client                            4.0.2
bosdyn-core                              4.0.2
bosdyn-graph-nav-api-msgs                4.0.2
bosdyn-keepalive-api-msgs                4.0.2
bosdyn-log-status-api-msgs               4.0.2
bosdyn-metrics-logging-api-msgs          4.0.2
bosdyn-mission                           4.0.2
bosdyn-mission-api-msgs                  4.0.2
bosdyn-msgs                              4.0.2
bosdyn-spot-api-msgs                     4.0.2
bosdyn-spot-cam-api-msgs                 4.0.2
```
If these packages were not installed correctly on your system, you can try manually installing them following [Boston Dynamics' guide](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/python/quickstart#install-spot-python-packages).

The above command verifies the installation of the `bosdyn` packages from Boston Dynamics and the generated protobuf to ROS messages in the `bosdyn_msgs` package (these have `msgs` in the name). You can also verify the `bosdyn_msgs` installation was correct with the following command:
```bash
$ ros2 pkg xml bosdyn_msgs -t version
4.0.2
```

Finally, you can verify the installation of the `spot-cpp-sdk` with the following command:
```
$ dpkg -l spot-cpp-sdk
||/ Name           Version      Architecture Description
+++-==============-============-============-=================================
ii  spot-cpp-sdk   4.0.2        amd64        Boston Dynamics Spot C++ SDK
```
