## How to build `.deb`

(Largely borrowed from [here](https://gist.github.com/awesomebytes/196eab972a94dd8fcdd69adfe3bd1152))

### Get dependencies
You may need the latest pip, follow the [official instructions](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

Install [bloom](http://ros-infrastructure.github.io/bloom/):

```bash
sudo pip install -U bloom
```

Install fakeroot:

```bash
sudo apt-get install fakeroot
```

### Deal with rosdep
Bloom won't create a package that depends on something `rosdep` can't find.  Until `bosdyn_msgs` is distributed, we need to trick `rosdep` into thinking it exists:
1.  Clone `https://github.com/ros/rosdistro`
2.  Change `rosdep/base.yaml` to just list an empty target for `bosdyn_msgs`:

```bash
bosdyn_msgs:
  ubuntu: []
```
3.  Add a file `/etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d/8-local.list` with the entry:

```bash
yaml file:///<absolute path to base.yaml>
```

4.  Run `rosdep update` and make sure it can resolve the `bosdyn_msgs` key:

```bash
rosdep update
rosdep resolve bosdyn_msgs
```

### Get ready

To make a debian folder structure from the ROS package you must cd into
the package to be in the same folder where `package.xml` file is.

### Create debian structure

```bash
bloom-generate rosdebian --os-name ubuntu --os-version jammy --ros-distro humble
```

You can also let the tool guess some stuff:
```bash
bloom-generate rosdebian --ros-distro humble
```

You'll get something like this:

```bash
$ bloom-generate rosdebian --os-name ubuntu --os-version jammy --ros-distro humble

```

### Create binary debian

Having sourced the necessary dependencies (most probably `source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash`) execute:

```bash
fakeroot debian/rules binary
```

If you get the error:
```bash
dh: Command not found
```
You need to install:
```bash
sudo apt-get install dpkg-dev debhelper
```

In the end you'll get a line like:

```
dpkg-deb: building package 'ros-humble-spot-msgs' in '../ros-humble-spot-msgs_0.0.0-0jammy_amd64.deb'.
```

### Upload debian to GitHub

You should now have a `.deb` file containing the `spot_msgs` package. You need to upload that as a release to GitHub [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository). Please increment the version of the release. At some point we may consider automating this process but we don't have a formalized way of doing these precompilations yet.
